To run the Vote Extraction Tool to establish the current status of the STRAX Token Proposal vote, please follow the steps below:

1. Run a StratisMain Node with the following parameters:
    -txindex -addressindex
2.  Wait for the node to become fully synchronised. 
**Note:** This may take some time, feel free to reach out in Discord to obtain a *near-tip* data directory if you do not want to validate the chain yourself.

3.  Run this project with -vote as arguments whilst the StratisMain Node is still running.
    dotnet run -vote
